				<p> Turns out, I was missing a quotation mark in my css file (which you can <a href="../4/4.css">check</a>). So, yay, we got fonts! We'll pick this arbitrary "Raleway" font for now. The font change really pulls the site together--switching from Times New Roman to a nicer, more "modern"/"minimalist" font seems like a priority if you want your site to stop looking pathetic.</p>
				<p> We've got two main issues with the layout that I can't solve: the first is apparent: the paragraph elements and content div extend all the way to the left. I don't totally hate this--it'll have to go eventually, but for now it doesn't look THAT awful. Kind of like I'm talking to someone in a messenger client. The second issue is, if the page is made narrow, the content spits out at the bottom of the page, below the ostensibly 100% height sidebar.</p>
				<p> Oh, CSS. I have a feeling we're going to be enemies. </p>
				<p> Next on the checklist: a nicer color scheme. At one point, years ago, I'd bookmarked <a href="http://flatuicolors.com/">a</a> <a href="http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/">ton</a> <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">of</a> <a href="
http://coolors.co/>">color pickers</a>. So I picked out a nice, Cote d'Ivoire themed color scheme and defined some CSS variables (to re-use these colors). I... may want to pick non-Ivoirian-flag inspired colors tomorrow. But, the concept's there, that counts, right?</p>

				<p> Last task of the day, which will be convenient for me: previous, index, and next buttons. Boom. Added to the template. </p>

				<p> That's it for the day. Design work is really, really slow. I'd spend more time but it's 11:20pm on a Friday night and it's been an hour and I'm still in the office. Because I'm so dedicated to my job. I think we'll spend one more day on design and get back to the "good" stuff.</p>
