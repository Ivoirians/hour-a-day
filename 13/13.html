				<h2> WSGI</h2>

				<p>So, I follow the tutorial and write up a quick little Werkzeug app. But then I get to the section about actually running it--Werkzeug has its own HTTPServer for development, located in werkzeug.serving.run_simple. But for actually attaching it to nginx, it looks like WSGI is a layer of abstraction away from the CGI frameworks that Apache/nginx support. Which, I guess isn't too surprising. But that means I'm missing something, and I don't really know what I'm missing. I've been Googling around and finding all these articles about using FastCGI and uWSGI with nginx and I'm not sure what I should do. </p>

				<p> So let's work it out. To recap everything I know for sure: WSGI is Python's equivalent of CGI, a protocol for allowing applications to respond to HTTPRequests. Nginx is a web server. Nginx handles incoming requests and determines where they should be routed. Nginx has support for CGI programs, and it seems <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/cgi.html">it's possible to write Python programs as CGI scripts</a>.
