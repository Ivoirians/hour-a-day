				<h2> WSGI</h2>

				<p>So, I follow the tutorial and write up a quick little Werkzeug app. But then I get to the section about actually running it--Werkzeug has its own HTTPServer for development, located in werkzeug.serving.run_simple. But for actually attaching it to nginx, it looks like WSGI is a layer of abstraction away from the CGI frameworks that Apache/nginx support. Which, I guess isn't too surprising. But that means I'm missing something, and I don't really know what I'm missing. I've been Googling around and finding all these articles about using FastCGI and uWSGI with nginx and I'm not sure what I should do. </p>

				<p> So let's work it out. To recap everything I think I know: CGI is a protocol for allowing web servers to use scripts to respond to HTTPRequests. Nginx is a web server. Nginx handles incoming requests and determines where they should be routed. Nginx has support for CGI programs, and it seems <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/cgi.html">it's possible to write Python programs as CGI scripts</a>. But people don't like writing CGI scripts. Python developed a protocol called WSGI which is nicer to work with. Apache's web server has a mod_wsgi that allows it to directly serve Python WSGI applications. Nginx (as far as I can tell) does not. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/219110/how-python-web-frameworks-wsgi-and-cgi-fit-together">Potentially useful link.</a> </p>

				<p> One suggested way people use Nginx is to use a separate HTTP server to serve the WSGI requests, and then reroute the requests that go to Nginx to that separate, specialized server. Examples are Gunicorn, CherryPy or uWSGI. We're going to try using Gunicorn, because that's what I used (without really understanding) with my old Django app. Also, you have to be a dick to name a web-server uWSGI and jusr confuse everybody. </p>

				<p> So, we install Gunicorn. I'm getting a bit lost, but here's how I understand it: I write a WSGI program in Python with the help of Werkzeug. Gunicorn can run this program for me as a service, on some port of my choosing. Nginx can redirect requests for services to be served by this webserver, on that port. So overall, nginx -> Gunicorn -> Werkzeug. Wouldn't it be great if I could install a single program, and not three? I guess these are wildly different types of applications, and they all want to be modular and distinct. But still, this sort of workflow could totally be packaged together, right?</p>

				<p> Anyway, we install Gunicorn. About half an hour later of getting a feel for things, something exciting happens: we can run a <a href="svc/rollDie">Python program from a URL!</a> This really is the start of great things. But in the process, I opened an annoying can of worms. Deploys are a mess now. I can't do local testing of these nginx/gunicorn modules (well, not yet, at least), and I've got some files that I've only created on the remote server. And I've exposed a lot of shortcomings in my understanding of how nginx and Gunicorn and virtualenv work. I think I've done some redundant things, putting my services in the same path they would be as static files, even though nginx abstracts that out. I think I'm not supposed to check in my venv folder? That's what I feel worst about--every single Python library says something along the lines of, "you're using virtualenv, right? Well, you should." But I don't know how to use it. I run virtualenv in my project directory, pip install some stuff--and now what? Do I need to do anything to enter the environment later? Lastly, I assume running Gunicorn from the command line perpetually is a bad idea.</p>

				<p> All these things to figure out, tomorrow. I think I'm going to slow down and try to really understand what's happening and why I want it to happen. </p>
