			<p>As mentioned yesterday, we're going all-in to make this page look nicer. The goal today is to get from 1990s page to a 2000s Wordpress page. First up, header and toolbar. </p>

			<h2> Header/Sidebar </h2>

			<p>Half an hour in and this is the most painful thing I've done in recent memory. The frustration of being completely unable to do a very, very simple thing--arrange a header, sidebar, and content pane, where the header and sidebar are fixed size and the content pane fills in everything to the right of the sidebar, and never slides down below the sidebar--it's so simple, and I hate to assume I'm just a moron, so I can't help but conclude that this is the worst.</p>
			
			<p> In the end, I'm settling for imperfect. For an unknown reason, my &lt;p&rt; tags are extending all the way to the right, <a href="CSS.png">overlapping with the sidebar</a>. But the text is shifted fine. I read through the CSS description of how float and divs/spans work but still, I'm going to need more practice. </p>

			<p> I think the greatest value in these hour-long sessions is that I plan out what I'm going to do and have a checklist to run down. I don't have anything cool to do with buttons besides the button in yesterday's widget. So, onto... </p>

			<h2> Fonts </h2>
			<p> It seems like the way to use custom fonts in HTML5 is "font-face", which allows you to host an OTF or TFF and display it. However, my font-face/font-family implementation doesn't seem to work, and it's been more than an hour of earnest work and I haven't figured out why.</p>

			<p> I also spent a significant amount of my day reading about why Chrome won't support MathML. It's kind of heartbreaking. Read <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=152430">here</a> from comment #43 on to see the outrage. I'm rationalizing why I didn't get much done today by how much time was spent reading and learning--I've still made progress, and that's what counts. More to do tomorrow. </p>
