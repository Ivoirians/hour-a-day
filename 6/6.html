				<p>This isn't supposed to be a web design blog--I want to try using things like Firebase and asm.js to build cool apps. But it's definitely a part of "building a website", and I want to minimize how ashamed I'd feel about sharing one of those apps down the line. I think I'll spend one more day on it, and then just settle for whatever I have. Tomorrow, I'll be looking at ways of adding a custom comment section, which may entail moving some hosting over to my own servers.</p>

				<h2> Design </h2>
				<p>Of course, the color design from yesterday needs to go. I've been looking at ways to quickly swap out colors, and using something like Paint or Adobe Illustrator to mock up the site would almost surely be the easiest way to do that. But, even before I try that, I don't know exactly what I'm doing--what color should my header/sidebar be? </p>

				<p> Fifteen minutes later, I've settled on the colors you see now. This looks pleasant enough. I've defined a variable for each component of the page, so trying out new colors is pretty simple. I will probably continue to tweak this occasionally.</p>

				<p> Next on the list...oh okay, a logo! Time to get crackin' in Illustrator. Threw together something geometric and slapped it onto my template page. Adding it to the header requires some ugly CSS work, but I think I can make it happen.</p>

				<p> I noticed that on Firefox, the Raleway font doesn't show up. Drat. Not enough time left in the day to fix that today. But, otherwise, I'm pretty happy with this! I'm anticipating tomorrow will be fun. </p>
