				<h1> Hiatus </h1>
				<p> I fell asleep in the middle of the last day. And then life has hit and, for a while, I've genuinely been unable to find an hour in a day that I can devote to this project. Some days were busy and good. Some days were busy and bad. But then the busy days died away and I had trouble picking the project back up. </p>
				<p> Just a short break though, since I've got some busy days ahead of me. Let's say we'll return on Sunday, July 24th. The key (that I tried to bring up last time) is to find something I want to make, that I can be passionate about and get lost in. So we're going to make a small game. </p>
